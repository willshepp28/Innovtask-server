# Innovtask

Innovtask is an interactive task management web application, where users can signup, login, and add, delete, and track their tasks. The application also supports subtasks - when all subtasks are complete, the main task is marked as complete.

## Technology

This project is built using:

**Frontend:**

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A modern frontend build tool.
- Yarn: A fast, reliable, and secure dependency manager.

**Backend:**

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- Sequelize: A promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open source object-relational database system.

**Testing:**

- Jest: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework designed to simplify the testing of your application's workflow.
- supertest: A high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.
